## Introduction

Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in various scientific fields to model complex systems and phenomena that involve random processes. In this project, we utilize the Monte Carlo method to simulate the behavior of photons as they propagate through human tissue. This simulation takes into account multiple factors, such as tissue composition, scattering, absorption, and reflection, to predict the pathway and behavior of photons in a realistic and informative manner.

## Usage

To run the simulation and observe the photon pathway predictions, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the required dependencies and libraries installed (details provided in the [Installation](#installation) section).

2. **Configuration**: Adjust simulation parameters, tissue properties, and other settings as needed in the `config.json` file.

3. **Run Simulation**: Execute the simulation script using your preferred programming language (e.g., Python). The simulation will generate data and visualizations showcasing the predicted pathways of photons inside human tissue.

4. **Results**: Analyze the generated data and visualizations to gain insights into photon-tissue interactions. Use these results to inform your biomedical research, optical design, or related applications.
